Known issues:
- somehow code is generated that may delete WEnvironment; a quickfix is
  to change WEnvironment form protected to public, but that is obviously
  wrong
- the correctness of the introspection tool has not been verified. Most
  likely some methods that are part of the public API are not properly
  annotated. A known example are methods with preprocessor-conditional
  documentation.
- not all subdirectories of the Wt source tree are handled (only chart and
  http).
- the patchClasses.py may eliminate functionality that is currently
  problematic but that we do want to have available in PyWt.
- treeviewdragdrop example: when showing the 2nd level WMenu for right-click
  on a folder item, the 2nd level does not disappear.
- the bindinds have not been investigated for memory leaks or other memory
  problems. The memory management for some classes' bindings may have to be
  improved.
- when using a recursive event loop, all other sessions hang
